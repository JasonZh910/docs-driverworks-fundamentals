## Supported Log Types

Program – These are the logs of primary interest. Each of the named logs is associated with a major area of the Control4 system architecture.


Named – These logs are used by specific functional areas of the Control4 system. Each named logger rolls up to the root level of one of the program loggers and, if not specifically configured to behave differently, the logs for the named logger are always shown in the Program log of the root logger.


Syslog – The default Linux system logging is used by a couple of the Control4 systems processes.
