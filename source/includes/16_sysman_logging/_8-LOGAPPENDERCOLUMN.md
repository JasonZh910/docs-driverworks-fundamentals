## Adding a Log Appender Column

By default, the Log Appender column is not displayed on the Sysman Logging UI. This column can be added by right clicking on any of the column headers. Populate the Appender checkbox from the list of columns at the bottom of the menu:

The Appender column will be added to the view:
