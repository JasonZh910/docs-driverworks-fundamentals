## Sorting and Filtering the Log View

**Sorting the Log View**
The Log view can be sorted alphabetically by clicking within the column header area. Doing so will arrange the log information for that column (along with its associated data found in the other columns) alphabetically. The arrow displayed in the header indicates if the display is sorted alphabetically from top to bottom or bottom to top.

**Filtering Log Information**
Filters are provided for all of columns displayed in the Log View except for the Name and Destination columns. Filters are useful as they allow you to display only the logging information you desire.

By default, the Type column has a filter associated with it when the logging view is first accessed. You can tell that a column is filtered by the display of the filter icon:

Using the Filter icon in the Type column can display all of the active loggers. This includes the Named loggers and the Syslog loggers.

Right clicking within the Type column header will display the Filtering menu item. Clicking on it will display all of the available items found under the Log Type category. In our example above, we have selected all of the log types to show in our Logging display. Clicking on the Apply button will change our Logging UI to show all log types:

In the example above, we’re creating a filter for the status column. After the Filtering menu item is selected, all of the available statuses are displayed. Populating a checkbox, or checkboxes will dictate what information is shown in the UI. Clicking the Apply button will change our Logging view to this:

Because we chose the “set” item to filter our view on, the Logging screen only displays loggers with a status of set. Note the Filter icon is also now displayed in the Status column header.
