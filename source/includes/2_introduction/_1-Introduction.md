The DriverWorks Fundamentals Guide is intended to provide an overview of the fundamental components that make up a device driver as well as the architectural layers that a device driver must interact with.  As a driver developer, you are tasked with implementing this “interaction”. Successful driver developers build drivers that not only handle numerous dependencies placed on their driver code – but also seek out ways to enhance a device’s capabilities in an automated environment. This level of interaction manifests itself as seamless device integration, a high level of device controllability and ultimately - a quality end user experience. This is something we refer to as the Control4 Interoperability Model.

Beginning with O.S. 3.4.0, Control4 has delivered a set of new Driver Development Templates and a utility called JumpStart to accelerate your driver development efforts.   The use of these templates assumes knowledge of the content included in this guide. Please see the driver template repository for more information on how to leverage these templates:
