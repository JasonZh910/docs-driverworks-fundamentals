## Whatâ€™s New in 3.4.0

### History Event Notifications

Beginning with O.S. 3.4.0, drivers can provide a better experience for users receiving Event push notifications on smartphones or tablets. Users can now view these notifications and, if desired, select the notification and be taken directly to the relevant content within the Control4 app. This removes the previous need to navigate through the app to find the relevant information. Push notification content includes videos, images, text and dynamic buttons related to the event triggering the notification.
