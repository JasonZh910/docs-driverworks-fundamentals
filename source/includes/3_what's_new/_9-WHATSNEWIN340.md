## Whatâ€™s New in 3.4.0

### History Event Notifications

Beginning with O.S. 3.4.0, drivers can provide a better experience for users receiving [Event Push Notifications][1] on smartphones or tablets. Users can now view these notifications and, if desired, select the notification and be taken directly to the relevant content within the Control4 app. This removes the previous need to navigate through the app to find the relevant information.
