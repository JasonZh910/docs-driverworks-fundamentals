## Combo Driver

A Combo Driver refers to a driver that does not rely on a Control4 Proxy to provide a user interface displayed on Navigators. Rather, the driver’s UI is displayed within ComposerPro along with its defined variables, events and commands which are used for programming purposes. 

A Combo Driver is designated as such within the driver’s XML using the `<combo></combo>` element. See the example to the right. 

```xml
<combo>true</combo>
<proxies>
  <proxy name=“combo_driver_name”> ombo_driver_name</proxy>
</proxies>
```

The \<combo\> element tells Director that this driver does not use a proxy but provides its own UI within Composer.
