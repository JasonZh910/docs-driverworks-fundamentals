## Lua IDE

When creating a Lua driver, you may find it helpful to have a working version of Lua with an integrated development environment (IDE) installed on your PC in order to test your Lua functions and ensure they work as expected before you embed them in a .c4z file and attempt to load them into your project using Composer. There are numerous Lua IDEs available that will accomplish this. A simple Internet search for "Lua IDE" will return numerous options.
